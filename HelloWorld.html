    <h2>Anatomy</h2>

    <p>
        Young T. gigas are difficult to distinguish from other species of Tridacninae. 
        Adult T. gigas are the only giant clams unable to close their shells completely, 
        allowing part of the brownish-yellow mantle to remain visible.

    <h3>Largest Specimens</h3>

    <p>
        The largest known T. gigas specimen measured 137 centimetres (4 ft 6 in), and it weighed 230 kg (510 lb) dead and was estimated to be 250 kg (550 lb) alive.
        It was discovered around 1817 on the north western coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, and its shells are now on display in a museum in Northern Ireland.
